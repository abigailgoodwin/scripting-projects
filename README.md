# scripting-projects
A collection of some of my smaller scripting projects.

# Contents
* DatabaseScript: Reads from a .csv file to upload rows to a local database.
* LogScanner: Reads from a failed login log and produces an HTML report.

# Developer Notes
* These are projects that I don't expect to return to, and for that I haven't provided much documentation. You are warned.
